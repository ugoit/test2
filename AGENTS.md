# Agent rules (Codex)
- Keep PR small: one goal per PR.
- Do not add new dependencies unless explicitly required.
- Do not call external services unless explicitly requested.
- Update README when you change run/test steps.
- CI must pass: ruff format/check + pytest.
- Prefer simple, readable code over abstractions.
- If requirements are ambiguous, ask questions in the PR description.
